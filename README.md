MEET THE TEAM
--------------

###Garreth Nedved

I'm 21 years old and I'm a senior with a major in Computer Science. I'm interested in contributing to an open source project, especially this one since it involves video game development and charity for underprivileged youth.

###Gerritt Dorland

A Junior in credit standing, Gerritt Dorland is excited to finally work on a real, substantial project. He expects to leave this class with a better understanding of how to work with a team.

###Jeremy Nicholson 

A senior majoring in Computer Engineering. I'm excited about working in unity3d because making a game has always been a thought of mine.  I'll be able to take what I've learned in this course and put my thought into action.

###Ryan Mann

A junior majoring in Computer Science.  Ryan Mann is hoping to improve his knowledge of programming by working in groups (like people do in the workforce) and by trying out C#, a language he has never used before.
